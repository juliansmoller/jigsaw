The purpose of this project is to construct a jigsaw from square blocks. I actually created the puzzle in real life by painting and glugin together wood blocks that I purchased from an arts and crafts store. The final puzzle looks like the heart-shape image shown in the notebook, and consists of several dozen puzzle peices. I wanted to use every possible shape that can be formed from 6 or fewer wood blocks, with a preference for larger shapes. 

Some of the more interesting algorithms include:
-- generate all possible shapes that can be formed with n (e.g. 6) or fewer blocks
-- pack these shapes into an nxn grid (puzzle) without leaving any gaps
-- render an image of the resulting puzzle, with adjacent peices painted in  different colors

Check out the image of the final puzzle! It's in "data/input"
